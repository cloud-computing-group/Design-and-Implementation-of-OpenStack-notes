OpenStack structure:

"Cloud" means services which can be accessed through Internet, according to the type of these services, "Cloud Computing" can be categoried in tree formats:

*IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): "Consumer can apply hardware or virtual hardware, including Bare Metal and Virtual Machine, which means apply processing capability, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources through Internet, where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls)."

*PaaS (Platform as a Service): "Computing environment and Development environment are considered as kind of service, and provided to consumer through Internet. User can apply a Virtual Machine which has already installed operating system and other necessary software, library to support an application (user can select to install any applications they like) to run. However, it is not allowed to modify pre-installed operating system and development environment."

*SaaS (Software as a Service): "Provide online software/application as servoce. Those softwares/applications are run in the server side. Consumer can lease the softwares/applications through Internet by recieving an account and a password. Normally, consumer access the softwares/applications by leasing but not buying."
